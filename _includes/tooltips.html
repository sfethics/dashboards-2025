            <h5>What is a Candidate Controlled Committee?</h5>
            <p class="text-secondary">A candidate controlled committee is a campaign committee established, financed, or controlled by a candidate for local office.</p>
            <p class="text-secondary">Once a committee raises or spends $2,000 or more, it must file regular campaign finance statements (Form 460) with the Ethics Commission, including semiannual reports at the end of January and July, and three pre-election statements   in the weeks before an election. They are prohibited from coordinating their spending decisions with third-party committees. Under San Francisco law, no person other than the candidate may contribute more than $500 to a candidate's committee for a single election.</p>

            <h5>How This Data is Calculated</h5>
            <p class="text-secondary">The totals shown represent the combined funds raised and spent by all candidate controlled committees for each office in the current election. Funds are aggregated by summing the itemized and unitemized contributions on schedules A and C from Form 460 and contributions received on Form 497 and Form 496P3. Funds also includes Loans from Form 460 Schedule B1, and Public Funds approved by the Ethics Commission as part of the San Francisco Public Financing Program.   Expenses are aggregated by summing the itemized and unitemized expenditures on schedules E and F. Figures are rounded to the nearest thousand.  Data is updated nightly, reflecting the filings made the previous day.</p>
