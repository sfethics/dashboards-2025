            <h5>What is a Third-Party Committee?</h5>
            <p class="text-secondary">A third-party committee is a political committee that raises and spends money to support or oppose candidates for local office but operates independently of those candidates and their campaigns. These committees are often called independent expenditure committees or primarily formed committees. They are prohibited from coordinating their spending decisions with any candidate or candidate controlled committee. Third-party committees are not subject to contribution limits.</p>
            <p class="text-secondary">Once a committee raises or spends $2,000 or more, it must file regular campaign finance statements (Form 460) with the Ethics Commission, including semiannual reports at the end of January and July, and three pre-election statements in the weeks before an election. In addition, third-party committees must disclose independent expenditures (Form 496) and contributions made or received (Form 497) within 24 hours during the 90-days before the election.</p>
            
            <h5>How This Data is Calculated</h5>
            <p class="text-secondary">The totals shown represent the combined funds raised and spent by all third-party committees for each office in the current election. Data is aggregated by summing the itemized and unitemized contributions on schedules A and C and loans from schedule B1 from Form 460 and contributions received on Form 497 and Form 496P3 filed electronically with the San Francisco Ethics Commission, which are made public through the Commission's disclosure system. Figures are rounded to the nearest thousand.  Data is updated nightly, reflecting the filings made the previous day.</p>
