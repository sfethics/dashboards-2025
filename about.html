<h1 class="mt-5">About the Campaign Disclosures Website</h1>

<p>
    This site provides easy access to campaign finance information for San Francisco elections.
    It is designed to help voters explore how candidates, committees, and third parties raise
    and spend money in local races, as well as how these activities may influence ballot measures
    and candidate contests. Visitors can browse summaries of filings, view activity over time, and
    search contributors across participating committees.
</p>

<p>
    The goal is to make complex campaign finance data easier to understand, encourage public
    participation, and promote transparency in San Francisco elections.
</p>
