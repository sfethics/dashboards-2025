# About The Campaign Disclosures Web Site

This site provides easy access to campaign finance information for San Francisco elections. It is designed to help the public explore how candidates, committees, and third parties raise and spend money in local races, as well as how these activities may influence ballot measures and candidate contests. Visitors can browse summaries of filings, view activity over time, and search contributors across participating committees.

The goal is to make complex campaign finance data easier to understand, encourage public participation, and promote transparency in San Francisco elections.
